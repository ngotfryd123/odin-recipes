    <h2>This is my own version of Chick-fil-a's egg white grill sandwich.</h2>
    
    <p>
        I enjoyed this breakfast sandwich so much from Chick-fil-a that I decided to make<br>
        my own version of it. I like it because it's very simple to make and it keeps me full for a long time.<br>
        It's a juicy grilled chicken breast sandwiched by an english muffin with melted american cheese and a grilled rounded egg white.

        <li>1 slice of american cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of egg whites</li>

            Season it with salt and pepper both sides. Place it on the grill medium heat<br>
            grilling both sides until the chicken breast juices run clear.
        </li>
        <li>Place eggwhites in a small pot that is round and takes the shape of the muffin.<br>
            Set it to low heat and take out when it has solidified.

        <li>Place cheese on one half of the muffin and place the eggwhite on the other half<br>
            with the chicken on top. Put the halves together and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
