# odin-recipes

In this project, I am building a homepage called odin recipes that links to 3 recipes relatively.
From completing this project, I have learned several things about Html, Git, Github and the command prompt.

In Html:

I have learned how to build the basic functional layout called the boilerplate.
That includes the Doctype which tells the browser what version of html it will deal with.
After that we include an Html tag that is the root element of all elements after it. All our elements are nested in it.
Next the head element, which includes the meta coding for dealing with fonts special characters and languages.
In the body element we add everything we want to display such as parargraphs, headings, lists, images and so forth.

Nesting:

The relationship between the head element and the body element is that they are siblings because they are on the same level.

The html element nests every element so it is the parent of those elements and they are the children elements to it.

Absolute vs Relative links/paths:

The way I sourced my images is called absolute linking because I took them from the internet rather than locally on my computer.

I used relative paths to connect my 3 recipe links to my homepage because they were stored locally on my pc.



In Git:

I learned that it works locally on my computer to take snapshots of my files over time when there are changes I would like to add. I've learned the commands to add changes to files/folders and when I'm ready with those changes, commit them to git. Finally when I'm ready to publish my work, I know how to push them to Github.



In Github:

It works remotely to gather your all projects and share them with other developers or employers. I've learned how to connect my projects from github to my computer.

In Command line:

I've learned how to move around in and out of directories, move files and directories around and also create them.
